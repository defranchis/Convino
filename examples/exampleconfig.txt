Comments within the blocks have to begin with #.
The input block lists the measurement files. For details, please see exampleMeasurement1.txt
The other blocks are commented individually

[correlations]
	
	# This block defines the assumptions on the correlations that are not given 
	# in the individual measurement files. (They can be redefined here, though)
	# It is adviced that most correlations that are known are given in the measurement files,
	# e.g. the case for fully consistent estimates obtained in measurements from one experiment.
	
	# The syntax for correlation assumptions defined here is as follows:
	# parameter = (<nominal correlation> & <scan from> : <to>) <other parameter> + <other correlations with same syntax>
	# Example: sys_b1 has a nominal correlation of 0.2 to sys_c2
	#          this correlation should be scanned from -0.1 to 0.4
	
	sys_a1 =  (0 & -0.9 : 0.9) sys_b2
	# or without a scan:
	#    sys_b1 = (0.2) sys_c2
	# more than one correlation simultaneously:
	
	sys_a1 = (0.2 & -0.9 : 0.9) sys_c2 + (0.2 & 0.4 : -0.4) sys_c1

[uncertainty impacts]

    # This block defines individual uncertainties or groups of uncertainties that should be evaluated 
    # with respect to their impact on the final combination results.
    # The procedure applied here is to fix the values under question and evaluate the difference in  
    # quadrature w.r.t. the uncertainty on the combined results.
    # The resulting table of uncertainties does not represent independent uncertainty groups
    # and serves as illustration, only.
