This is an example of a measurement file.
The description can be written in this header and will be ignored by the program.
Comments can be made also within the blocks. Here they have to follow a "#"
A measurement file can contain one or many estimates (or measurements) for one or many quantities.
It is not strictly necessary, but adviced that estimates affected by uncertainties known correlations 
(e.g. from one experiment) are summarised in one file.

This file described a measurement with orthogonal uncertainties. For this purpose, a simplified input
can be used. Instead of defining a hessian or a correlation matrix, the estimates and uncertainties can 
be given in a few lines (see "not fitted" marker).

For non-orthogonal uncertainties, see exampleMeasurement2.txt

  # This block can be used to describe fully orthogonal uncertainties.
  # A measurement can be affected by these uncertainties, only, or these
  # uncertainties have been externalised from a measurement using a simultaneous
  # likelihood fit.
  # 
  # Entries in this block are separated by white spaces. The entries are as follows
  #                <uncertainty name 1> <uncertainty name 2> <uncertainty name 3> ... stat
  # <estimate 1>   <contributions in absolute values>   ...                           
  # <estimate 2>   <contributions in absolute values>   ...   
  #                
  # The keyword "stat" is reserved for the statistical uncertainty.
  # In case, this block is used to define additional externalised uncertainties (hessian,  
  # or correlation matrix provided), the latter entry will be ignored. 
  #
  # The following is an example of a measurement with orthogonal uncertainties:
