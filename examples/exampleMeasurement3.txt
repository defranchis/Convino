This is an example of a measurement file.
The description can be written in this header and will be ignored by the program.
Comments can be made also within the blocks. Here they have to follow a #
A measurement file can contain one or many estimates (or measurements) for one or many quantities.
It is not strictly necessary, but adviced that estimates affected by uncertainties known correlations 
(e.g. from one experiment) are summarised in one file.


[hessian]
  # 
  # Numerically, the best way is to provide the Hessian of the measurement
  # if it does not exclusively include orthogonal uncertainties.
  # The hessian should be given with best precision possible.

[not fitted]
  # 
  # In addition to fitted uncertainties described by the hessian,
  # also additional uncertainties, orthogonal to all others,
  # can be added here. The "stat" entry will be ignored
  #
  # In this block, asymmetric uncertainties can be added, too
  # the syntax is: 
  # (+X-Y), where X is the upward variation and Y the downward variation.
  # (-X+Y) or (+X+Y) or (-X-Y) are also possible and the sign information
  # is propagated accordingly
  #
  # An example is provided below
