This measurement file describes a measurement with correlations between its
systematic uncertainties and constraints on them. These are given in form of 
a correlation matrix. For an example with a hessian as input, please refer to 
exampleMeasurement3.txt


[correlation matrix]
  #
  # The first row defines the name of each uncertainty or estimate
  # The second row describes the constraints in absolute values on the
  # parameters. In case of the estimates, it corresponds to the
  # total uncertainty obtained by the fit used to measure them.
  # Starting from the thrird row, the correlations are defined in 
  # triangular form. The correlation matrix should be given with best
  # precision possible.
  # And example is shown below:
