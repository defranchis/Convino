The Convino method [1] allows to combine measurements obtained with simultaneous nuisance parameter fits. These are performed by fitting a model as a function of the parameters of interest and its uncertainties to the measured data. As a result of such a measurement, the uncertainties are correlated among each other and receive constraints from the data as well as from prior assumptions. The best approach for a combination of these measurement would be a maximization of a combined likelihood, which includes the models of all measurements and the original data of all measurements. Only in rare cases, this information is publicly available. The Convino method can be used to model a likelihood equivalent to the combined likelihood based on the public result and its covariance or Hessian, only.
The method is incorporated in the Convino program that provides a text-based user interface, that can be used without knowledge of programming, alongside a {\Cpp} interface. The latter also integrates ROOT histogram and graph classes for simple combination of binned measurements such as differential cross sections. The program is not limited to measurements obtained with simultaneous nuisance parameter fits. 

For a complete description of the method and the program, see [1].
